# number-of-weeks

An algorithm that calculates the number of weeks (full or partial) within a given month, based on Sunday being the first day of the week.

`vanilla.js` shows how this can be done using plain JS (no dependencies).

`luxon.js` shows how this can be done using [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html).
